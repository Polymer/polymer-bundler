The scenario is an app imports home.html which imports utils.html. home.html
is specified as a fragment though, and then gets inlined before utils.html,
causing runtime errors. Removing home.html as a fragment fixes the issue.

<link rel="import" href="importing-fragments/shell.html">

<script>
  console.log('eagerly-importing-a-fragment.html');
