## Unreleased
<!-- Add new, unreleased changes here. -->

## 2.3.1 - 2017-07-13
- Rolling back these changes from 2.3.0 release which break polymer 1.x bundling case and going to release them in polymer-bundler 3.x because they are breaking changes:
  - Fixed [issue #579](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler/issues/579) where `url()` values inside `<style>` tags inside of `<dom-module>` tags of inlined html imports were rewritten without consideration of the module's `assetpath` property.
  - Fixed issue when stylesheet imports are inlined inside of a `<dom-module>` the url resolution now takes into consideration the `assetpath`.

## 2.3.0 - 2017-07-12
- Fixed issue where inlined `<link rel="import" type="css" ...>` "stylesheet imports" (deprecated but still supported) were inlined in reverse order.  Fixes [issue #575](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler/issues/575).
- Added a `missingImports` property to the `Bundle` class (part of the `BundleManifest`).
- The JSON generated by `--manifest-out` now includes a `_missing` url collection when any are encountered that could not be loaded.
- Added missing `--rewrite-urls-in-templates` option to `bin/polymer-bundler`.
- Fixed issue where HTML imports which were not inlined, because they matched an entry in the `excludes` option, were being erroneously added to the bundle's `missingImports` set.

## 2.2.0 - 2017-06-28
- Fixed issue where bundles produced by shell strategy incorrectly included eager html imports of the shell. https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler/issues/471
- Fixed the `--inline-scripts` and `--inline-css` options, previously inlining happened regardless of whether the options were actually set.  Important, if you use the `bin/polymer-bundler` CLI you must provide these options to inline scripts and css now.
- Fixed issue producing assetpath in application root. https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler/issues/562
- Fixed issue where absolute paths were not handled properly. https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler/issues/559
- Fixed issue where out-dir was essentially ignored for a single bundle case. https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler/issues/560
- Fixed issue where, if a different version of polymer-analyzer was given to Bundler's constructor, it caused instanceof check failures and resulting in documents not being identified as documents; added more definitive error messaging for this scenario as stop-gap until we switch to a no instanceof version of polymer-analyzer interface.

## 2.1.0 - 2017-06-14
- Added a `--redirect` option to `bin/polymer-bundler`.
- Added a `--root` option to `bin/polymer-bundler`.
- Added support for preserving important comments of the form `<!--! ... -->` when using `stripComments`.
- The `excludes` option now supports excluding specific script and css file and containing folder urls.
- The `stripComments` behavior now removes comments inside templates.
- Fixed issue with incorrect URL rewrites in inlined CSS (when URL points outside of the package root). https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler/issues/531
- Fixed error when generating source maps due to original line or column not being available. https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler/issues/516
- Fixed `--manifest-out` option to include inlined scripts and styles and emit during single bundle cases. https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler/issues/549 and https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler/issues/550

## 2.0.3 - 2017-06-07
- Fixed issue with lazy-imports impacting bundle inlining logic. https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler/issues/536
- Fixed issue with hidden div being created inside dom-modules. https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler/issues/535
- Fixed issue with injected dependencies inside dom-modules in shell when using lazy-imports. https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler/issues/534

## 2.0.2 - 2017-06-02
- In cases such as the shell merge strategy, imports which are not originally
  part of the shell are now inserted before other imports which are dependent
  on them.  Fixes https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler/issues/517.

## 2.0.1 - 2017-05-19
- Don't include the `by-polymer-bundler` hidden div in bundled files
  if it is empty.

## 2.0.0 - 2017-05-18
- Official 2.0.0 release of polymer-bundler! ðŸŽ‰
- Fixed a bug with url-rewriting in cases where base urls provided
  has mix of relative and absolute pathnames.

## 2.0.0-pre.18 - 2017-05-15
- Updated dependency on `polymer-analyzer` to ^2.0.0 now that it is
  out of alpha.

## 2.0.0-pre.17 - 2017-05-11
- BREAKING: Bundler's `bundle()` method now returns a `BundleResult`
  instead of just a document collection. It does this to include a
  copy of the provided manifest, where each bundle includes a record
  of the sets of imports which were inlined during bundling.

## 2.0.0-pre.16 - 2017-05-10
- Fixed issue where an inlined import's `<link rel="lazy-import">` href
  was being adjusted, but should not be adjusted when governed by the
  containing dom-module's assetpath.

## 2.0.0-pre.15 - 2017-05-08
- Fixed case where an inlined import's `<link rel="lazy-import">` tags
  were being moved.
- Updated `polymer-analyzer` to latest version.

## 2.0.0-pre.14 - 2017-05-03
- BREAKING: Bundler options now include `strategy` and `urlMapper`.  These
  have been moved out from the `generateManifest` method which now only
  takes the `entrypoints` array.  If you had code that used this method,
  you'll need to move those parameters to your `new Bundler({...})` call.
- Added new url mapper functions to make customizing destination of shared
  bundle files easier: `generateSharedBundleUrlMapper` and
  `generateCountingSharedBundleUrlMapper` in `src/build-manifest`.
- Fixed an issue where `<link rel="lazy-import">` tags were being moved
  out of their containing `<dom-module>` tags.
- Export all of the bundle manifest types and functions on the default
  namespace of `polymer-bundler`.

## 2.0.0-pre.13 - 2017-05-01
- BREAKING: Bundler now supports "lazy imports" aka `<link rel="lazy-import">`.
  URLs which are imported lazily are implicitly treated as entrypoints.  This
  is a breaking change because, previously, Bundler would incorrectly treat
  lazy imports just like regular imports.
- BREAKING: Bundler now inlines Scripts and CSS by default.  Pass `inlineCss`
  and `inlineScripts` as `false` explicitly to disable.
- Fixed an issue where `exclude` option did not actually support folder names.

## 2.0.0-pre.12 - 2017-04-14
- BREAKING: Public API change.  The `bundle()` method now takes a manifest
  instead of entrypoints, strategy and mapper.  To produce a manifest,
  use new public method `generateManifest()`.
- The polymer-bundler CLI now uses the current working directory as
  the package root folder for its Analyzer, allowing absolute paths to
  resolve properly.
- Fixed an issue where an immediate `<style>` child of `<dom-module>` was
  not moved into generated `<template>`.
- BREAKING: Added option `rewriteUrlsInTemplates` to support rewriting of urls
  found in `src`, `href`, `action`, `assetpath` and `style` attributes
  found inside `<template>` elements, when inlining html imports.  Previously,
  this was done by default.  Now requires explicit option.
- BREAKING: inlinining functions in `import-utils` require an explicit
 `analyzer` argument.
- BREAKING: Dropped support for node v4, added support for node v8. See our
  [node version support policy]
  (https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/node-support) for details.
- Fixed an issue where bundler was adding `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags
  to documents that didn't have them.
- Removed unused/not-implemented options from the polymer-bundler CLI and
  corresponding `Bundler` options: `strip-exclude`, `no-implicit-strip` and
  `redirect`.
- Corrected the CLI usage output.
- Corrected the README.

## 2.0.0-pre.11 - 2017-03-20
- Bump dependency on analyzer

## 2.0.0-pre.10 - 2017-03-15
- Add a sourcemap option to properly handle or create sourcemaps for
  script tags

## 2.0.0-pre.9 - 2017-03-07
- Bump dependency on analyzer

## 2.0.0-pre.8 - 2017-03-03
- Uses `polymer-analyzer` directly to obtain import document sources and
  ASTs.  This enforces agreement with the Analyzer as to which documents
  should be inlined/bundled.
- Fixes issue where protocol-less URLs (those that start with `//`) were
  treated as absolute paths.
- Renamed/refactored to draw a clearer distinction between ASTs and
  documents.
- Fixes issue where absolute paths in urls would be rewritten in unexpected
  ways because they were not resolved by the same url resolver rules used
  by the Analyzer.

## 2.0.0-pre.7 - 2017-03-03
- Bump dependency on analyzer.

## 2.0.0-pre.6 - 2017-02-17
- Handle `<base href="...">` values correctly when inlining imports.
- Apply `<base target="...">` to links and forms in the same document as
  appropriate.
- License comments are deduplicated properly now.
- Server-Side Include comments `<!--# ... -->` are no longer stripped.
- Fixed a bug where element attributes inside `<template>` tags were not
  being rewritten when html imports were inlined.

## 2.0.0-pre.5 - 2017-02-14
- Handle base tags when resolving the dependency graph of imports.

## 2.0.0-pre.4 - 2017-02-06
- Fixed a bug where bundling using generateShellMergeStrategy would result in
  builds missing imports which should have been appended to shell.

## 2.0.0-pre.3 - 2017-01-31
- Changed the way bundle documents are generated, so that bundles based on a
  source file retain their HTML structure instead of always being synthesized
  from a blank document.
- bundle() is the only public method on Bundler class now.
- Bundler does not explicitly throw an error if it spots a `<polymer-element>`
  somewhere in a document.
- `--add-import` and `--importUrl` options have been removed.  These features,
  as expressed, need to be conceptually reworked to work in bundler's new
  multi-bundle paradigm.
- `--abspath`/`basePath` have been removed, anticipating their reimplementation
  in `polymer-build`.  https://github.com/polymer/polymer-build/issues/117

## 2.0.0-pre.2 - 2017-01-17
- Minor API difference the way Bundler class is exported to make it import
  friendly.
- Reduced set of files in published package.

## 2.0.0-pre.1 - 2017-01-17
- Complete rewrite of codebase in Typescript and changed from hydrolysis to
  polymer-analyzer.
- Built-in support for build sharding.
- Optionally generates a manifest of each bundle's imports.

## 1.15.3 - 2017-01-17
- Fix for how paths are rewritten in nested import scenarios where paths to same
  directory were ignored instead of treated as "." for relative path.

## 1.15.2 - 2016-12-16
- Fix for how assetpath is set when in the same directory, where assetpath attribute
  for components in same directly were incorrectly set to "/".

## 1.15.1 - 2016-12-16
- Amended README and minor text fixes to CHANGELOG post release.

## 1.15.0 - 2016-12-16
